Teensy Audio Meter
==================

This project takes audio in via USB, processes it on a Teensy 4.0 to
calculate various statistics on the audio stream (such as level,
spectrum, loudness, and stereo separation) and renders those to a
small display and a pair of LED bargraphs. The audio is also output
via a PT8211 DAC for headphone monitoring. Control is managed via
three pushbuttons.
